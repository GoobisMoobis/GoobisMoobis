Problem #31

let x = the total cost of the pizza

4.50/x ≥ 3/10
4.50 ≥ (3/10)x
4.50 * (10/3) ≥ x
15 ≥ x

Final answer: x ≤ 15
The pizza costs at most $15.00

----------------------------------------

Problem #36

let x = Gilberto's final test score
(86 + 88 + 78 + x)/4 ≥ 85
86 + 88 + 78 + x ≥ 85(4)
86 + 88 + 78 + x ≥ 340
252 + x ≥ 340
x ≥ 88

Final answer: x ≥ 88
Gilberto must score at least 88 on the final test

1.
let h = number of hours
Original inequality:
15 + 2h ≤ 35
2h ≤ 20
h ≤ 10

Final answer: h ≤ 10
Jay can rent the detector for at most 10 hours

----------------------------------------

2.
let x = age of youngest brother

Original inequality:
x + (x+1) + (x+2) > 60  (sum of brothers' ages > father's age)
3x + 3 > 60
3x > 57
x > 19

Final answer for part a/b: x > 19
The youngest brother is older than 19 years old

Part c - Age of oldest brother:
Since we found x > 19:
- Youngest brother (x) is older than 19
- Middle brother (x+1) is older than 20
- Oldest brother (x+2) is older than 21

Since we're told the brothers are exactly one year apart and x > 19:
The oldest brother must be 22 years old because:
1. If he were 21, x would be 19, which doesn't satisfy x > 19
2. The sum of their ages (22 + 21 + 20 = 63) is greater than father's age (60)
3. Any younger ages wouldn't satisfy x > 19, any older ages would unnecessarily exceed the father's age

Final answer for part c: The oldest brother is 22 years old

----------------------------------------

4.
let x = number of stamps
Original inequality:
0.49x ≤ 10  (cost of stamps ≤ money available)
x ≤ 20.41
x ≤ 20

Final answer: x ≤ 20
Keshila can buy at most 20 stamps

----------------------------------------

5.
where x = number of people
Original inequality:
100 + 40x ≤ 520
40x ≤ 420
x ≤ 10.5

Since we can't have partial people, round DOWN
x ≤ 10

Final answer: x ≤ 10
Nathaniel can invite at most 10 people

----------------------------------------

6.
Original inequality:
5x - 1 ≥ -11
5x ≥ -10
x ≥ -2

Final answer: x ≥ -2

----------------------------------------

7.
Original inequality:
21 > 15 + 2x
6 > 2x
3 > x

Final answer: x < 3

----------------------------------------

8.
Original inequality:
-9 ≥ (2/5)x + 7
-16 ≥ (2/5)x
-40 ≥ x

Final answer: x ≤ -40

----------------------------------------

9.
Original inequality:
x/8 - 13 > -6
x/8 > 7
x > 56

Final answer: x > 56

----------------------------------------

10.
Original inequality:
-x + 6 ≤ 5
-x ≤ -1
x ≥ 1

Final answer: x ≥ 1

----------------------------------------

11. 
Original inequality:
37 < 7 - 10x
30 < -10x
-3 > x

Final answer: x < -3
